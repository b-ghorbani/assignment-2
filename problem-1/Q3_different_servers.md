Running Each Namespace on a Separate Server
When each network namespace (such as node1, node2, and router) is deployed on a different physical or virtual server, you must use tunneling protocols to maintain Layer 2 connectivity between them. This enables all nodes to communicate as if they are on the same local network.

Recommended Solutions
VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN)
VXLAN creates a Layer 2 overlay network on top of existing Layer 3 infrastructure.

Key Benefits:

Encapsulates Ethernet frames for transmission over IP.

Allows bridges on different servers to act as if they are on the same network.

Setup Steps:

Create a bridge on each server:

bash
ip link add br0 type bridge
ip link set br0 up
Set up a VXLAN interface on each server:

bash
ip link add vxlan0 type vxlan id 42 dev eth0 remote <Server2_IP> dstport 4789
ip link set vxlan0 up
Attach the VXLAN interface to the bridge:

bash
ip link set vxlan0 master br0
Connect each namespace's veth to the local bridge as usual.

GRE Tunnel (Generic Routing Encapsulation)
GRE tunnels can encapsulate Layer 2 or Layer 3 packets between servers.

Setup Steps:

Create a bridge on each server:

bash
ip link add br0 type bridge
ip link set br0 up
Set up a GRE tunnel interface:

bash
ip link add gre1 type gretap remote <Server2_IP> local <Server1_IP> ttl 64
ip link set gre1 up
Attach the GRE interface to the bridge:

bash
ip link set gre1 master br0
Connect each namespace's veth to the local bridge as usual.

Additional Configuration
Routing:
Ensure each namespace has a default route pointing to the appropriate gateway (router namespace or bridge IP).

ARP Settings:
Make sure ARP works correctly across tunnels for proper MAC address resolution. Enable Proxy ARP or adjust bridge settings if needed.

Firewall:

For VXLAN: Open UDP port 4789.

For GRE: Allow IP protocol 47.

Example: VXLAN Setup (Server 1)
bash
# Create bridge
ip link add br0 type bridge
ip link set br0 up

# Create VXLAN interface
ip link add vxlan0 type vxlan id 42 dev eth0 remote <Server2_IP> dstport 4789
ip link set vxlan0 up

# Attach VXLAN to bridge
ip link set vxlan0 master br0

# Attach node1's veth to br0 as usual
Summary Table
Protocol	Layer	Typical Use	Required Firewall	Notes
VXLAN	2	Overlay	UDP 4789	Modern, scalable
GRE	2/3	Overlay	IP protocol 47	Simple, legacy
Conclusion
When namespaces are distributed across multiple servers, VXLAN or GRE tunnels are required to interconnect their bridges at Layer 2. Proper routing and ARP configuration are essential for seamless communication. This approach enables scalable, multi-host network topologies, similar to those used in cloud-native and container orchestration environments.

Tip:
For best results, always check your bridge and tunnel interfaces with ip link and bridge link commands, and verify connectivity with ping and arp -a inside each namespace.
