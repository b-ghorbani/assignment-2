Running Each Namespace on a Separate Server
If each network namespace (e.g., node1, node2, and router) is running on a different physical or virtual server, and you want to maintain Layer 2 connectivity between them, you need to use tunneling protocols to connect the bridges across servers.

Recommended Solutions
VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN):
VXLAN allows you to create a Layer 2 overlay network on top of a Layer 3 infrastructure. Each server runs a bridge, and VXLAN tunnels encapsulate Ethernet frames, enabling the bridges to act as if they are on the same local network.

Setup Steps:

Create a bridge on each server.

Set up a VXLAN interface on each server, connecting to the remote servers' IP addresses.

Attach the VXLAN interface to the bridge.

Connect each namespace's veth interface to the local bridge.

GRE Tunnel (Generic Routing Encapsulation):
GRE tunnels can also be used to encapsulate Layer 2 or Layer 3 packets between servers.

Setup Steps:

Create a bridge on each server.

Set up a GRE tunnel interface between the servers.

Attach the GRE interface to the bridge.

Connect each namespace's veth interface to the local bridge.

Additional Configuration
Routing:
Ensure that each namespace has a default route pointing to the appropriate gateway (which could be the router namespace or the bridge IP).

ARP Settings:
Make sure ARP works correctly across the tunnels so that MAC address resolution functions as expected. In some cases, you may need to enable Proxy ARP or adjust bridge settings.

Firewall:
Open the required UDP ports for VXLAN (default is 4789) or IP protocol 47 for GRE in your firewall settings.

Example: VXLAN Setup Snippet
bash
# On Server 1:
ip link add br0 type bridge
ip link set br0 up
ip link add vxlan0 type vxlan id 42 dev eth0 remote <Server2_IP> dstport 4789
ip link set vxlan0 up
ip link set vxlan0 master br0

# Attach node1's veth to br0 as usual
Summary
When namespaces are distributed across multiple servers, VXLAN or GRE tunnels are required to interconnect their bridges at Layer 2. Proper routing and ARP configuration are essential to ensure seamless communication between the namespaces. This approach enables scalable, multi-host network topologies similar to those used in cloud-native and container orchestration environments.
