What Happens If the Router Is Removed?
If the router network namespace is removed from the topology, the two subnets (e.g., 172.0.0.0/24 and 10.10.1.0/24) become completely isolated from each other. Nodes in one subnet will not be able to communicate with nodes in the other subnet, because there is no Layer 3 (routing) device to forward packets between the two networks.

How to Enable Communication Without a Router
To re-establish connectivity between the subnets without a router namespace, you need to implement packet forwarding at the bridge level in the root namespace. There are two main approaches:

Bridge Forwarding:
You can configure the Linux bridges to forward traffic between the interfaces. However, bridges operate at Layer 2 and will only forward packets if they are on the same broadcast domain. Since the subnets have different IP ranges, simple bridging is not sufficient for Layer 3 communication.

NAT (Network Address Translation) Rules:
You can use iptables to set up NAT rules (such as SNAT or DNAT) on the bridges in the root namespace. This allows packets from one subnet to be translated and routed to the other subnet. For example, you can use the following commands to enable IP forwarding and set up a MASQUERADE rule:

bash
sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o br2 -j MASQUERADE
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o br1 -j MASQUERADE
With these rules, packets leaving each bridge will have their source IP rewritten, allowing return traffic to be properly routed back.

Proxy ARP or Static Routes:
Alternatively, you can use Proxy ARP or add static routes in each namespace so that they know how to reach the other subnet via the bridges.

Summary
Without a router, direct communication between the two subnets is not possible unless you implement NAT or advanced bridge forwarding techniques in the root namespace. This setup is less flexible and scalable than using a dedicated router namespace.
